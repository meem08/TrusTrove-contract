## What is TrusTrove?

TrusTrove is a decentralized trade finance protocol on Stellar. SMEs tokenize unpaid invoices and receive immediate USDC funding from a shared liquidity pool. Liquidity providers deposit USDC and earn yield from discount fees when invoices repay. No banks, no brokers — four Soroban smart contracts handle everything.

## Contracts

### registry_contract

Tracks verified SME issuers and buyers. Every other contract calls `is_verified()` before allowing any action.

```
initialize(admin)
register_issuer(address, metadata) → bool
register_buyer(address, metadata) → bool
is_verified(address) → bool
get_profile(address) → Profile
revoke(address) → bool
```

### invoice_contract

Manages the full invoice lifecycle. Enforces valid state transitions. Emits events consumed by the Go indexer.

```
Created → Listed → Funded → Active → Confirmed → Repaid
                                    ↘ Defaulted
```

```
create(issuer, buyer, face_value, due_date) → invoice_id
list_for_financing(invoice_id, discount_bps) → bool
mark_funded(invoice_id, funded_amount) → bool   ← pool_contract only
mark_shipped(invoice_id) → bool
confirm_delivery(invoice_id, confirmer) → bool  ← dual confirmation required
repay(invoice_id) → bool
trigger_default(invoice_id) → bool
get(invoice_id) → Invoice
get_by_status(status) → Vec<Invoice>
get_by_issuer(address) → Vec<Invoice>
```

### escrow_contract

Holds USDC between pool funding and issuer payout. Only callable by `pool_contract`.

```
lock(invoice_id, amount) → bool
release_to_issuer(invoice_id) → bool
release_to_pool(invoice_id, repayment_amount) → bool
handle_default(invoice_id) → bool
get_locked(invoice_id) → u128
```

### pool_contract

USDC liquidity pool with share-based LP accounting. Share price grows as invoices repay.

```
deposit(lp, usdc_amount) → shares
withdraw(lp, shares) → usdc_amount
fund_invoice(invoice_id) → bool
receive_repayment(invoice_id, amount) → bool  ← invoice_contract only
handle_default(invoice_id) → bool
get_stats() → PoolStats
get_lp_position(address) → LPPosition
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.85.0 (required — other versions either have WASM bugs or are blocked by Stellar CLI)
- [Stellar CLI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-cli) (latest)

### 1. Install Rust 1.85.0

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.85.0
rustup target add wasm32v1-none --toolchain 1.85.0
```

### 2. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrusTrove/TrusTrove-contract.git
cd TrusTrove-contract
rustup run 1.85.0 stellar contract build
```

### 3. Run tests

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

### 4. Deploy to testnet

```bash
# Create and fund a deployer account
bash scripts/setup-testnet.sh

# Fund via browser: https://friendbot.stellar.org/?addr=YOUR_ADDRESS

# Deploy all four contracts
bash scripts/deploy.sh
```

The deploy script prints all four contract IDs at the end. Paste them into `TrusTrove-app/.env.local`.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from Rust and Soroban developers. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a PR.

### Find an issue

Issues are labeled by contract and complexity:
- `complexity:low` — isolated function or test, good entry point
- `complexity:medium` — touches contract logic and storage
- `complexity:high` — cross-contract interactions or new mechanics

### Key conventions

- All amounts use `u128` in stroops (1 USDC = 10,000,000)
- All timestamps use `u64` Unix seconds
- Every `persistent().set()` must be followed by `extend_ttl()`
- Use `panic_with_error!` with typed errors — no bare `panic!` or `unwrap()` in production paths

### Commit format

```
feat(registry): add batch issuer registration function
fix(pool): guard against division by zero when total_shares is 0
test(invoice): add full lifecycle integration test
```
